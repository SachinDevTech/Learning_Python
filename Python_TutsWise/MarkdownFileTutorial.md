# Markdown Syntax Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It's widely used for formatting documents, README files, and web content. In this guide, we'll cover various Markdown syntax elements with examples.

---

## 1. Headings

Headings in Markdown are created using hash symbols (`#`). There are six levels of headings, where one hash symbol represents heading 1, two for heading 2, and so on.

Example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

## 2. Emphasis

You can apply emphasis to text using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.

- *Italic text* or _Italic text_
- **Bold text** or __Bold text__

## 3. Lists

### Unordered List

Unordered lists are created using hyphens (`-`), plus signs (`+`), or asterisks (`*`).

Example:

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2
```

### Ordered List

Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by periods.

Example:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   1. Sub-item 1
   2. Sub-item 2
```

## 4. Links

Links are created using square brackets `[]` for the link text and parentheses `()` for the URL.

Example:

```
[OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
```

## 5. Images

Images are similar to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` before the square brackets.

Example:

```
![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)
```

## 6. Blockquotes

Blockquotes are created using the greater than `>` symbol.

Example:

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

## 7. Code Blocks

Code blocks are created by wrapping the code with three backticks (```) and specifying the programming language.

Example:

\```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
\``` 

## 8. Tables

Tables are created using pipes `|` to separate columns and hyphens `-` for the header separator.

Example:

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Content 1| Content 2|
```

## 9. Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule is created using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.

Example:

```
---
```

## 10. Escaping Characters

You can escape Markdown characters using the backslash `\`.

Example:

```
\*This text won't be italicized\*
```

## 11. Task Lists

Task lists are created using hyphens `-` followed by brackets `[]` for incomplete tasks and `[x]` for completed tasks.

Example:

```
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
```

## 12. Strikethrough

Strikethrough text is created using two tilde `~~` symbols.

Example:

```
~~Strikethrough~~
```

## 13. Inline Code

Inline code is created by wrapping the code with single backticks (`).

Example:

```
Use `inline code` within a sentence.
```

## 14. Footnotes

Footnotes are created using square brackets `[^]` followed by a colon and the footnote text.

Example:

```
Here is a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```

## 15. Emoji

You can use emoji in Markdown by typing the emoji shortcode.

Example:

```
:smile: :star: :computer:
```
